	<h1>Joseph Seering</h1>
	<p>
	<br>
	I am a postdoc in the <b><a href = "https://hci.stanford.edu/" title="Stanford HCI Group website">HCI Group</a></b> in the <b><a href = "https://cs.stanford.edu/" title="Stanford CS website">Stanford CS Department</a></b><!--, and a postdoctoral fellow at the <b><a href = "https://hai.stanford.edu/" title="Stanford HCI Group website">Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence</a></b>-->.
	</p>
	<p>	
	I received my undergraduate degree from Harvard University in Social Studies in 2013, a Masters in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University in 2018 and a PhD in HCI from Carnegie Mellon in 2020. 
	</p>
	<p>
	In my work I explore community dynamics in online spaces, focusing on ways in which self-governance behaviors can be strengthened. To date, I have primarily explored moderation strategies, but have also done work on introduction of newcomers and methods for increasing engagement of members.
	In my research I begin with empirical analyses to understand community behaviors and challenges and then translate the findings of this research into design and development of new systems.
	Through my work, I aim to facilitate the design of more welcoming, tolerant, and supportive communities online.

	<h3> Current Projects </h3>
	<p>
	In my study of <b>community moderation practices</b> with <a href = "https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/geoff-kaufman" title="Professor Geoff Kaufman website">Geoff Kaufman</a>, I am examining the ways in which small informal  
	communities develop methods for managing behavior of community members. See more information <a href="modstudyverify.html" title="Link to more in-depth study description">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	I am also currently exploring users' <b>verbal responses to hate speech and harassment</b> in a project with <a href = "https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~diyiy/" title="Diyi Yang website">Diyi Yang</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	In a new line of work, I have begun exploring the ways in which <b>chatbots</b> can support communities in addressing some of the aforementioned challenges through meaningful social engagement with members.
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
	I also maintain a list of all the peer-reviewed research I have found that focuses primarily on Twitch, which can be found <a href = "https://twitter.com/josephseering/status/1054742018470092800" title="here">here.
