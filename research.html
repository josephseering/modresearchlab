		<h3>Metaphors in Moderation</h3>
		<p><i><b>Joseph Seering</b>, Geoff Kaufman, and Stevie Chancellor - New Media and Society 2020</i></p>
	</button>
		<div class="content"> 
		<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
		<p>Volunteer content moderators are essential to the social media ecosystem through 
		the roles they play in managing and supporting online social spaces. Recent work has 
		described moderation primarily as a functional process of actions that moderators 
		take, such as making rules, removing content, and banning users. However, the 
		nuanced ways in which volunteer moderators envision their roles within their 
		communities remain understudied. Informed by insights gained from 79 interviews 
		with volunteer moderators from three platforms, we present a conceptual map of the 
		territory of social roles in volunteer moderation, which identifies five categories with 
		22 metaphorical variants that reveal moderators’ implicit values and the heuristics 
		that help them make decisions. These metaphors more clearly enunciate the roles 
		volunteer moderators play in the broader social media content moderation apparatus, 
		and can drive purposeful engagement with volunteer moderators to better support the 
		ways they guide and shape their communities.</p>

		<h3>Reconsidering Community Self-Moderation: the Role of Research in Supporting Community-Based Models for Online Content Moderation</h3>
		<p><i><b>Joseph Seering</b> - CSCW 2020</i></p>
	</button>
		<div class="content"> 
		<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
		<p>Research in online content moderation has a long history of exploring different forms that moderation can
		take, including both user-driven moderation models on community-based platforms like Wikipedia, Facebook
		Groups, and Reddit, and centralized corporate moderation models on platforms like Twitter and Instagram.
		In this work I review different approaches to moderation research with the goal of providing a roadmap for
		researchers studying community self-moderation. I contrast community-based moderation research with
		platforms and policies-focused moderation research, and argue that the former has an important role to
		play in shaping discussions about the future of online moderation. I provide six guiding questions for future
		research that, if answered, can support the development of a form of user-driven moderation that is widely
		implementable across a variety of social spaces online, offering an alternative to the corporate moderation
		models that dominate public debate and discussion.</p>

		<h3>It Takes a Village: Integrating an Adaptive Chatbot into an Online Gaming Community</h3>
		<p><i><b>Joseph Seering</b>, Michal Luria, Connie Ye, Geoff Kaufman, and Jessica Hammer - CHI 2020</i></p>
	</button>
		<div class="content"> 
		<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
		<p>While the majority of research in chatbot design has focused on creating chatbots that 
		engage with users one-on-one, less work has focused on the design of conversational agents 
		for online communities. In this paper we present results from a three week test of a social 
		chatbot in an established online community. During this study, the chatbot ``grew up'' from 
		``birth'' through its teenage years, engaging with community members and ``learning'' 
		vocabulary from their conversations. We discuss the design of this chatbot, how users' 
		interactions with it evolved over the course of the study, and how it impacted the community 
		as a whole. We focus in depth on how we addressed challenges in developing a chatbot whose 
		vocabulary could be shaped by users. We conclude with implications for the role of machine 
		learning in social interactions in online communities and potential future directions for 
		design of community-based chatbots.</p>

		<h3>Proximate Social Factors in First-Time Contribution to Online Communities</h3>
		<p><i><b>Joseph Seering</b>, Jessica Hammer, Geoff Kaufman, and Diyi Yang - CHI 2020</i></p>
	</button>
		<div class="content"> 
		<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
		<p>In the course of every member's integration into an online community, a decision must be 
		made to participate for the first time. The challenges of effective recruitment, management, 
		and retention of new users have been extensively explored in social computing research. 
		However, little work has looked at in-the-moment factors that lead users to decide to 
		participate instead of ``lurk'', conditions which can be shaped to draw new users in at 
		crucial moments. In this work we analyze 183 million messages scraped from chatrooms 
		on the livestreaming platform Twitch in order to understand differences between first-time 
		participants' and regulars' behaviors and to identify conditions that encourage first-time 
		participation. We find that presence of diverse types of users increases likelihood of new 
		participation, with effects depending on the size of the community. We also find that 
		information-seeking behaviors in first-time participation are negatively associated with 
		retention in the sort and medium term.</p>

		<h3>"Taking Care of a Fruit Tree": Nurturing as a Layer of Concern in Online Community Moderation</h3>
		<p><i>Bingjie Yu, Katta Spiel, <b>Joseph Seering</b>, Leon Watts - CHI 2020 Late Breaking Work</i></p>
	</button>
		<div class="content"> 
		<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
		<p>Care in communities has a powerful influence on potentially disruptive social encounters. 
		Practising care in moderation means exposing a group’s core values, which, in turn, has the 
		potential to strengthen identity and relationships in communities. Dissent is as inevitable 
		in online communities as it is in their offline counterparts. However, dissent can be productive 
		by sparking discussions that drive the evolution of community norms and boundaries, and there is 
		value in understanding the role of moderation in this process. Our work draws on an exploratory 
		analysis of moderation practices in the MetaFilter community, focusing on cases of intervention 
		and response. We identify and analyse MetaFilter moderation with the metaphor: “taking care of a 
		fruit tree”, which is quoted from an interview with moderators on MetaFilter. We address the 
		relevance of care as it is evidenced in these MetaFilter exchanges, and discuss what it might 
		mean to approach an analysis of online moderation practices with a focus on nurturing care. We 
		consider how HCI researchers might make use of care-as-nurture as a frame to identify multi-faceted 
		and nuanced concepts characterising dissent and to develop tools for the sustainable support of 
		online communities and their moderators.</p>

		<h3>Designing Chatbots as Community-Owned Agents</h3>
		<p><i>Michal Luria, <b>Joseph Seering</b>, Jodi Forlizzi, John Zimmerman - CUI 2020 Provocation Paper</i></p>
	</button>
		<div class="content"> 
		<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
		<p>This work investigates how social agents can be designed to create a sense of ownership over them 
		within a group of users. Social agents, such as conversational agents and chatbots, currently interact 
		with people in impersonal, isolated, and often one-on-one interactions: one user and one agent. 
		This is likely to change as agents become more socially sophisticated and integrated in social fabrics. 
		Previous research has indicated that understanding who owns an agent can assist in creating expectations 
		and understanding who an agent is accountable to within a group. We present findings from a three week 
		case-study in which we implemented a chatbot that was successful in creating a sense of collective 
		ownership within a community. We discuss the design choices that led to this outcome and implications 
		for social agent design.</p>

		<h3>Peer Feedback Processes in the Game Industry</h3>

	</button>
		<div class="content"> 
		<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
		<p>A wide variety of design strategies, tools, and processes are used across the game industry. Prior work has shown that these 
		processes are often collaborative, with experts in different domains contributing to different parts of the whole. However, 
		the ways in which these professionals give and receive peer feedback have not yet been studied in depth. In this paper we 
		present results from interviews with industry professionals at two game studios, describing the ways they give feedback. We 
		propose a new, six step process that describes the full feedback cycle from making plans to receive feedback to reflecting and 
		acting upon that feedback. This process serves as a starting point for researchers studying peer feedback in games, and 
		allows for comparison of processes across different types of studios. It will also help studios formalize their understanding 
		of their own processes and consider alternative processes that might better fit their needs.</p>

		<h3>Toward a Twitch Research Toolkit: A Systematic Review of Approaches to Research on Game Streaming</h3>

	</button>
		<div class="content"> 
		<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
		<p>The rise of game streaming services has driven a complementary increase in research on such platforms. As this new area takes shape, 
		there is a need to understand the approaches being used in the space, and how common practices can be shared and replicated between 
		researchers with different disciplinary backgrounds. In this paper, we describe a formal literature review of game streaming research. 
		Papers were coded for their research focus, primary method, and type of data collected. Across the prior work we found three common themes: 
		(1) work that is readily supported by existing technical infrastructure, (2) work that does not require explicit technical support, 
		(3) and work that would benefit from further technical development. By identifying these needs in the literature, we take the first step 
		toward developing a research toolkit for game streaming platforms that can unify the breadth of methods being applied in the space.</p>

		<div class="content"> 
		<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
		<p>Large-scale streaming platforms such as Twitch are becoming increasingly popular, but detailed audience-streamer interaction dynamics 
		remain unexplored at scale. In this paper, we perform a mixed methods study on a dataset with over 12 million audience 
		chat messages and 45 hours of streamed video to understand audience participation and streamer performance on Twitch. We uncover five 
		types of streams based on size and audience participation styles, from small streams with close streamer-audience interactions 
		to massive streams with the stadium-style audiences. We discuss challenges and opportunities emerging for streamers and 
		audiences from each style and conclude by providing data-backed design implications that empower streamers, audiences, live streaming platforms, and game designers.</p>

		<h3>Beyond Dyadic Interactions: Considering Chatbots as Community Members</h3>
		<p><i><b>Joseph Seering</b>, Michal Luria, Geoff Kaufman, and Jessica Hammer - CHI 2019</i></p>
	</button>
		<div class="content"> 
		<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
		<p>Chatbots have grown as a space for research and development in recent years due both to the realization of their commercial potential and to advancements in language processing that have facilitated more natural conversations. 
		However, nearly all chatbots to date have been designed for dyadic, one-on-one communication with users. In this paper we present a comprehensive review of research on chatbots supplemented by a review of commercial and independent 
		chatbots. We argue that chatbots’ social roles and conversational capabilities beyond dyadic interactions have been underexplored, and that expansion into this design space could support richer social interactions in online 
		communities and help address the longstanding challenges of maintaining, moderating, and growing these communities. In order to identify opportunities beyond dyadic interactions, we used research-through-design methods to generate more 
		than 400 concepts for new social chatbots, and we present seven categories that emerged from analysis of these ideas.</p>

		<h3>Designing User Interface Elements to Improve the Quality and Civility of Discourse in Online Commenting Behaviors</h3>

		<div class="content"> 
		<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
		<p>Ensuring high-quality, civil social interactions remains a vexing challenge in many online spaces. In the present work, we introduce a novel approach to address this problem: using psychologically “embedded” CAPTCHAs containing stimuli 
		intended to prime positive emotions and mindsets. An exploratory randomized experiment (N = 454 Mechanical Turk workers) tested the impact of eight new CAPTCHA designs implemented on a simulated, politically charged comment 
		thread. Results revealed that the two interventions that were the most successful at activating positive affect also significantly increased the positivity of tone and analytical complexity of argumentation in participants’ responses. A focused follow-up experiment (N = 120 Mechanical Turk 
		workers) revealed that exposure to CAPTCHAs featuring image sets previously validated to evoke low-arousal positive emotions significantly increased the positivity of sentiment and the levels of complexity and social connectedness in 
		participants’ posts. We offer several explanations for these results and discuss the practical and ethical implications of designing interfaces to influence discourse in online forums.</p>

		<h3>The Channel Matters: Self-disclosure, Reciprocity and Social Support in Online Cancer Support Groups</h3>

		<div class="content">
		<p><b>Abstract</b></p> 
		<p>People with health concerns go to online health support groups to obtain help and advice. To do so, they frequently disclose personal details, many times in public. Although research in non-health settings 
		suggests that people self-disclose less in public than in private, this pattern may not apply to health support groups where people want to get relevant help. Our work examines how the use of private and public channels influences members’ self-disclosure in an
		online cancer support group, and how channels moderate the influence of self-disclosure on reciprocity and receiving support. By automatically measuring people’s self-disclosure at scale, we found 
		that members of cancer support groups revealed more negative self-disclosure in the public channels compared to the private channels. Although one’s self-disclosure leads others to self-disclose and to 
		provide support, these effects were generally stronger in the private channel. These channel effects probably occur because the public channels are the primary venue for support exchange, while the 
		private channels are mainly used for follow-up conversations. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of our work.</p>

		<div class="content"> 
		<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
		<p>Online communities provide a forum for rich social interaction and identity development for billions of internet users worldwide. In order to manage these communities, platform owners have increasingly turned to commercial 
		content moderation, which includes both the use of moderation algorithms and the employment of professional moderators, rather than user-driven moderation, to detect and respond to anti-normative behaviors such as harassment and
		spread of offensive content. We present findings from semi-structured interviews with 56 volunteer moderators of online communities across three platforms (Twitch, Reddit, and Facebook), from which we derived a generalized model 
		categorizing the ways moderators engage with their communities and explaining how these communities develop as a result. This model contains three processes: being and becoming a moderator; moderation tasks, actions, and responses;  
		and rules and community development. In this work, we describe how moderators contribute to the development of meaningful communities, both with and without algorithmic support.</p>

		<p>Bots, or programs designed to engage in social spaces and perform automated tasks, are typically understood as automated tools or as social "chatbots." In this paper, we consider bots’ place alongside users within diverse

		<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
		<p>Research in computer-supported cooperative work has historically focused on behaviors of individuals at scale, using frames of interpersonal interaction such as Goffman’s theories of self-presentation. These 
		frames prioritize research detailing the characteristics, personal identities, and behaviors of large numbers of interacting individuals, while the social identity concepts that lead to intra- and inter-group dynamics 
		have received far less attention. We argue that the emergent properties of self-categorization and social identity, which are particularly fluid and complex in online spaces, provide a complementary perspective with 
		which to re-examine traditional topics in social computing. We discuss the applicability of the Social Identity Perspective to both established and new research domains in CSCW, proposing alternative perspectives on selfpresentation, 
		social support, collaboration, misbehavior, and leadership. We propose a set of methodological considerations derived from this body of theories and accompanying empirical work. We close by considering 
		how broad concepts and lessons from social identity provide a valuable lens for inspiring future work in CSCW.	</p>

		<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
		<p>Online communities have the potential to be supportive, cruel, or anywhere in between. The development of positive norms for interaction can help users build bonds, grow, and 
		learn. Using millions of messages sent in Twitch chatrooms, we explore the effectiveness of methods for encouraging and discouraging specific behaviors, including 
		taking advantage of imitation effects through setting positive examples and using moderation tools to discourage antisocial behaviors. Consistent with aspects of imitation theory and deterrence theory, users imitated examples of 
		behavior that they saw, and more so for behaviors from high status users. Proactive moderation tools, such as chat modes which restricted the ability to post certain content, 
		proved effective at discouraging spam behaviors, while reactive bans were able to discourage a wider variety of behaviors. This work considers the intersection of tools, authority, and types of behaviors, offering a new frame 
		through which to consider the development of moderation strategies.</p>

		<p><b>From Overview</b></p>
		<p>Student learning outcomes have long been established as an important component in the process of developing subject content, communicating expectations to students, and designing effective
		assessments. This project focused on mapping the relationships among outcomes across the undergraduate curriculum in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT. Through this project, 
		we expanded upon existing sets of outcomes and created new sets where none previously existed to connect subjects in the undergraduate curriculum in an integrated framework.</p>

	<h3>The Importance of Looking Closer: Understanding Motivations for Bad Behavior Online</h3>
	<p><i>Joseph Seering and Geoff Kaufman - CHI 2018 Workshop on "Understanding 'Bad Actors' Online"</i></p>
	<p>"Harassment, spam, hate speech, and a wide variety of other destructive behaviors abound in online communities.  In this paper  we  argue  that,  in  order  to  address  them,  we  must move beyond labeling of “Bad Actors” and 
	instead into in-depth explorations of their motivations. This will require continued  work  in  domains  from  ethnography  to  experimental psychology. In this paper we identify three challenges to understanding these 
	motivations and offer three theory-based hypotheses to inform future explorations."

	<h3>Social Identity Theory and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work</h3>
	<p><i>Joseph Seering and Geoff Kaufman - CSCW 2017 Workshop on "Theory transfers? Social theory and CSCW research"</i></p>
	<p>"In this paper, we explore some of the traditional domains of social identity theory, discuss some of the newer extensions of social identity theory, and talk both
	about how a deeper understanding of social identity theory can benefit CSCW research and how, in return, CSCW can contribute new insights and directions for 
	extending social identity theory."

	<h3>Exploring Identity Signals on an Anonymous Mobile Posting App</h3>
	<p><i>Joseph Seering and Laura Dabbish - CSCW 2016 Workshop on Social Signaling Theory</i></p>
	<p>"Users are drawn to anonymous apps because of the appeal of the protection provided by anonymity or partial disclosure of identifying information. Partial or complete
	anonymity supports identity exploration and social boundary management but presents challenges in discerning user sincerity and expertise through
	conventional signals. This project focuses on understanding how users evaluate the posts of others in an anonymous and ephemeral setting on the mobile anonymous mobile posting app Yik Yak."
